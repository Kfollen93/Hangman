# Hangman

Classic Hangman, the rules are simple:

1. Computer sets a word, you guess one letter per turn.
2. You have 6 turns to guess the word correctly.
3. A turn will only be used if the guess is incorrect.

You also have the option to save at any point. Feel free to exit the game and load your save upon return!
